### MDVRP
The Multi-Depot Vehicle Routing Problem (MDVRP), an extension of classical VRP, is a
NP-hard problem for simultaneously determining the routes for several vehicles from multiple depots to
a set of customers and then return to the same depot. 

The objective of the problem is to find routes for
vehicles to service all the customers at a minimal cost in terms of number of routes and total travel
distance, without violating the capacity and travel time constraints of the vehicles.

### Genetic Algorithm
* **Gene**: Customer or TODO: Depot
* **DNA**: List of genes/Part of a route
* **Chromosome**: Full DNA/List of merged DNAs/Full Route
